							  <h1>Constant Contact API Terms and Conditions</h1>
						<h3>CONSTANT CONTACT API LICENSE AGREEMENT</h3>
						<p><b>This is a legal agreement (the “Agreement”) between the you and, if applicable, your company, organization or other legal entity for whom you have authority to enter into this Agreement (“Developer”) and Constant Contact, Inc. (“Constant Contact”), for use of certain of Constant Contact's Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) that enable Developer to provide additional functionality for users of Constant Contact products or to integrate access to certain Constant Contact products into Developer's product offerings. By clicking “I agree to the terms of service,” or otherwise accessing the APIs, Developer indicates its acceptance of this Agreement.</b></p>
						
						
						<p><strong><a id="TOC_1"></a>1.&nbsp;<b>Enabling Access; Developer Obligations.</b></strong></p>
						<p><b>1.1 Offering Integration; API Documentation.</b> During the term of this Agreement, Developer may use the APIs to provide capabilities or integrations that leverage one or more the Constant Contact products available at www.constantcontact.com (the “Constant Contact Products”) into additional functionality, products, websites and/or services that are offered by Developer (the “Offerings”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Constant Contact may make available to Developer the Constant Contact API and any corresponding reference materials (including API documentation, wrapper libraries, sample code and API updates and changes) and source code, which may be amended or revised by Constant Contact at any time (the “Constant Contact API Documentation”), for use for such purposes during the term of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><b>1.2.&nbsp; Developer Information; Consent to Contact. </b>&nbsp;Developer shall provide Constant Contact with Developer’s contact information and hereby consents to Constant Contact sharing such information with any User (defined below) or prospective User of the Offering.&nbsp; Developer shall update the contact information, as needed, such that Constant Contact always has current contact information for the Developer and the Offering.&nbsp; By entering into this Agreement, Developer consents to receiving phone calls, emails, texts or any other type of messages from Constant Contact to inform it of changes or additions to the Constant Contact Products, this Agreement, the APIs or the API Documentation and any other matter related to the foregoing and for general marketing purposes (Developer may unsubscribe from marketing messages at any time, but not transactional messages).&nbsp; Constant Contact may, but is not obligated to, monitor or record any telephone conversations and chat texts for quality control purposes, for purposes of training employees and for Constant Contact’s own protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
						<p><b>1.3 User Terms and Conditions.</b> Developer acknowledges and agrees that users of the Offerings (“Users”) must be Constant Contact account holders for a Constant Contact Product in order to access and use such Constant Contact Product through the Offerings. Developer further acknowledges and agrees that all Users' access and use of the Constant Contact Products is subject, in all respects, to the User Agreements.&nbsp; Developer hereby agrees to either: (i) require all Users to agree to the User Agreements prior to permitting such users to access the Constant Contact Products through the Offerings; or (ii) only provide access to Constant Contact Products in a manner that requires Users to register with Constant Contact directly and accept the User Agreements. Developer further agrees that, to the extent Developer uses the Constant Contact Products on its own behalf or on behalf of its customers, Developer's use shall be subject to the User Agreements in all respects.&nbsp; Developer agrees that it may use the APIs to add or update only customers that have been obtained by the User using permission-based standards that meet standards described in the User Agreements.&nbsp; The “User Agreements” are defined as Constant Contact's Web Site and Products Terms and Conditions of Use, Privacy Statement, Anti-Spam Policy, and any other acceptable use policy, content restrictions, user agreements, and other terms and conditions governing use of the Constant Contact Products, generally available through the Constant Contact websites, as each of the foregoing may be amended by Constant Contact from time to time in its sole discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>
						<p><b>1.4 Privacy Policy; Customer Accounts.</b> Developer represents, warrants and covenants that, in its operation of the Offerings, it will maintain and comply with a privacy policy that complies with applicable law and that accurately discloses how Developer collects, uses, stores, and discloses data provided by Users and third parties.&nbsp; Developer will post its privacy policy in the Offerings. &nbsp;Further, if Developer has any login, customer or other account information relating to a User's account with Constant Contact, Developer shall only use such information for the purposes expressly authorized by the applicable User.</p>
						<p><b>1.5 Responsibility for Offerings.</b> Developer is solely responsible for the Offerings and Constant Contact shall have no liability or obligations with respect to the same (including support obligations).&nbsp; Developer represents, warrants and covenants that Developer has and will at all times maintain the right to provide all Offerings provided by Developer hereunder and that the Offerings (and any other materials provided to Constant Contact or Users) do not infringe the intellectual property or other rights of any third parties or contain viruses, worms, malware or any other harmful scripts or code.&nbsp; Developer agrees to provide support for its Offerings.&nbsp; Developer shall ensure that all Offerings that access the Constant Contact Products comply with all applicable laws and regulations.&nbsp; Developer agrees to place the following notice prominently in the Offering:&nbsp; “This product uses the Constant Contact API but is not endorsed or certified by Constant Contact.”</p>
						<p><b>1.6 Fees.</b> The APIs are currently provided for free, but Constant Contact reserves the right to charge for the APIs in the future.&nbsp; If Constant Contact does charge a fee for the use of the APIs or any developer tools and features, Developer does not have any obligation to continue using the APIs.</p>
						<p><strong><a id="TOC_2"></a>2. Licenses; Restrictions.</strong></p>
						<p><b>2.1 License.</b> Constant Contact hereby grants to Developer a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited&nbsp; license to use and integrate the APIs into the Offering for the sole purpose of developing the integration to the Offering and allowing access to the Constant Contact Products via the Offering. Once integrated into the Offering, access to the APIs may then be distributed to the Users as an integrated part of the Offering.</p>
						<p><b>2.2 Responsibilities; Restrictions.</b> Developer shall implement the APIs in accordance with the Constant Contact API Documentation.&nbsp; Developer may not access the APIs if Developer is a competitor of Constant Contact, as determined by Constant Contact in its reasonable discretion, or to replicate or attempt to replicate the essential user experience of the Constant Contact Products. &nbsp;Except as expressly provided herein, Developer has no other right to install, integrate, use, reproduce, sublicense or distribute APIs. Developer shall not: (i) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise alter or attempt to gain access to the APIs or the Constant Contact Products in a manner not in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) use or enable its customers to use the APIs for the purposes of testing or comparison of Constant Contact Products or for any purpose competitive with Constant Contact Products, or (iii) perform bulk operations with APIs that are designed for single contact operations or perform single contact operations with APIs that are designed for performing bulk operations. Developer agrees to protect the security and confidentiality of any credentials and API keys disclosed by Constant Contact hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
						<p><b>2.3 Ownership; No Other Licenses.</b> The APIs contained in the Offering shall remain the sole and exclusive intellectual property of Constant Contact and Developer shall reasonably assist Constant Contact in protecting such ownership. No other licenses or rights in any of Constant Contact's intellectual property rights are granted hereunder. For example and without limitation, no rights are granted to use Constant Contact's logos or trademarks; provided, however that Developer may refer to the names of the Constant Contact Products solely for the purpose of describing the Offering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
						<p><b>2.4 Right to Developer's Ideas, Logo and Name.</b> Developer hereby grants to Constant Contact a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license (i) to use any ideas that Constant Contact learns from observing Developer's Offerings or other use of the APIs or any feedback provided by Developer and (ii) to use Developer's name and logo for the purpose of disclosing that Developer is providing Offerings using the APIs and for promotion of the availability of the APIs.</p>
						<p><strong><a id="TOC_3"></a>3. Non-Exclusivity.</strong>&nbsp;Developer acknowledges that Developer's right to use and demonstrate the Constant Contact Products hereunder is non-exclusive, and that Constant Contact reserves the right to sell and distribute any of its services to any customers in the world, and to appoint any third party to do so, without giving Developer notice thereof and without incurring any liability to Developer therefore. Constant Contact reserves the right to develop and extend its products and capabilities without regard to whether those products compete with or invalidate any Developer Offering. &nbsp;Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, Constant Contact may contact directly any User for the purpose of marketing and selling the Constant Contact Products. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, in the event that such User elects to purchase the Constant&nbsp;Contact Products, Constant Contact shall have no obligation to Developer with respect to such transaction.&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong><a id="TOC_4"></a>4. Indemnification; Limitation of Liability; Disclaimer.</strong></p>
						<p><b>4.1 Indemnification.</b> Developer shall defend, indemnify and hold Constant Contact and its underlying service providers, business partners, third-party suppliers and providers, members of its network, account providers, licensors, officers, directors, employees, distributors and agents harmless from and against any lawsuit, claim, damage, liability, or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Constant Contact as a result of any third-party claim against Constant Contact resulting from or relating to the Offering, Developer’s use of the APIs, Constant Contact's use of the Developer’s marks, the content on Developer's website, Developer's unauthorized marketing, promotion, use or distribution of the Constant Contact Products, Developer's failure to abide by the applicable terms of any User Agreement, Developer's breach of this Agreement, or the infringement or misappropriation of any patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right of any third party.</p>
						<p><b>4.2&nbsp; Limitation of Liability</b>.&nbsp; EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF CONSTANT CONTACT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL CONSTANT CONTACT OR ANY OF ITS UNDERLYING SERVICE PROVIDERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS AND PROVIDERS AND MEMBERS OF ITS NETWORK, ACCOUNT PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION AS "CONSTANT CONTACT") BE LIABLE TO DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY MONEY DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF CONSTANT CONTACT SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), THE MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CONSTANT CONTACT TO DEVELOPER ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO $100.&nbsp; SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY.</p>
						<p>Developer agrees that Constant Contact has made the APIs available and entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the disclaimers of warranty and the limitations of liability set forth herein, that they reflect an allocation of risk between the parties (including the risk that a contract remedy may fail of its essential purpose and cause consequential loss), and that they form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.</p>
						<p><b>4.3 Disclaimer</b>. &nbsp;DEVELOPER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE APIS AND THE CONSTANT CONTACT PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. USE OF THE APIS OR THE CONSTANT CONTACT PRODUCTS AND ANY RELIANCE BY DEVELOPER UPON THE APIS OR THE CONSTANT CONTACT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY ACTION TAKEN BY DEVELOPER BECAUSE OF SUCH USE OR RELIANCE, IS AT DEVELOPER’S SOLE RISK. CONSTANT CONTACT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE APIS OR THE CONSTANT CONTACT PRODUCTS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, NOR DOES CONSTANT CONTACT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SAME. CONSTANT CONTACT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. NO STATEMENT OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM CONSTANT CONTACT IN ANY MEANS OR FASHION SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY AND EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.&nbsp; CONSTANT CONTACT MAY MODIFY OR TERMINATE OR RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE APIS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>CONSTANT CONTACT SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER FOR DEVELOPER’S COMPLIANCE WITH OR BREACH OF ANY LICENSE OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES.</p>
						<p>NO CLAIM MAY BE ASSERTED BY DEVELOPER AGAINST CONSTANT CONTACT MORE THAN 12 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION UNDERLYING SUCH CLAIM. DEVELOPER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY FAILURE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THE APIS OR THE PRODUCTS SHALL BE FOR CONSTANT CONTACT TO USE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ADJUST OR REPAIR THE APIS OR THE PRODUCTS.&nbsp;</p>
						<p>DEVELOPER HEREBY WAIVES CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 (IF DEVELOPER IS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT), AND ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION (IF DEVELOPER IS A RESIDENT OF SUCH JURISDICTION).</p>
						<p><strong><a id="TOC_5"></a>5. Term; Termination.</strong>&nbsp;Developer may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing to provide Offerings and sending a confirmatory e-mail to the Web Services Coordinator (webservices@constantcontact.com).
